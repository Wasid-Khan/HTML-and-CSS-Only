# HTML and CSS Only
The HTML and CSS only repository contains various project and small task exploring the power of CSS particularly. I try to avoid the use of JavaScript, a great language, and altogether the complexities involved. The repository contains the following tasks and they are updated regularly. I learn and code the tasks and project.

1. # 3D Slider animation:
   A Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) only slider. I'm practicing my skills to harden my impromptu reply to any problem solution.
3. # Hover Effect :
   A specialized hover effect. I try to access the left and right items while hovering. The key aspect is the use of (+ *) and the has(+ *) method.
